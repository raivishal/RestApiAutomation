# Serialization and De-serialization are the ways to parse the request/response(from Java object to JSON or vice-versa).
# it makes code more readable.
1- Serialization :
	* it is a process of converting Java object into Request Body (JSON/XML Payload).
	* it can be done with the support of POJO class.
	
2- De-serialization :
	* it is a process of converting Response(JSON/XML) body to Java object.

	
De-Serialization ----------
	-if request/response type is JSON, then we need to have Jackson, Jackson2, Gson libraries.
	-if request/Response type is XML, then we need to have JAXB library.
